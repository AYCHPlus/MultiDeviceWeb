Summary
------

  - Run the app on port 3001 to strip CSS and JavaScript includes.
  - The web app has three different main layouts - i.e. go to 'working' and zoom in and out to see them in action.
  - The 'working' and 'done' states have a pull function, making 'backlog' and 'verify' feel more like queues.
