KANBAN API
==============

The API only emits JSON. You need to specify the Accept header (with the value application/json) to get JSON in the response.
The API also supports the suffix .json on resources for development purposes.

Any resources that returns HTML should be considered experimental and should not be used.


items/backlog
  GET: returns all the items in todo state
  POST: form post with id moves the item with that id to the backlog state

items/working
  GET: returns all the items in working state
  POST: form post with id moves the item with that id to the working state

items/verify
  GET: returns all the items in verifying state
  POST: form post with id moves the item with that id to the verify state

items/done
  GET: returns all the items in done state
  POST: form post with id moves the item with that id to the done state


The rules for moving items are:

 - Items in state todo are only allowed to go to working
 - Items in state working are only allowed to go to todo or working
 - Items in state verify are only allowed to go to working or done
 - Items in state done are only allowed to go to todo
